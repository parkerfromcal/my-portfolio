    fullDescription:
      "The agency formerly known as the Corporation for National and Community Service rebranded to AmeriCorps and as part of this effort, migrated their website from Drupal 7 to Drpal 8, re-themed to match their new branding, and re-structured their primary website. My roles were product owner, project manager, information architect, front-end developer, and Drupal administrator. I installed and configured Drupal modules, developed content types, views, and taxonomies, and was decision maker on site structure and functionality. I contributed to theme development, served as scrummaster, led a successful phase 1 and phase 2 launch, and administered training post-launch. I was also the primary developer once we returned to regular operations and maintenance of the site.",

    fullDescription:
      "Inspired by the real company, BIC Auctions, this website was an experiment to present if they should ever decide to move from a template to a standalone site. This was the second project I worked on using Bootstrap and the first where I was the sole developer. I added accordions, tabs, and other style features in addition to some Javascript for search and other onClick functionality.",

    fullDescription:
      "My introduction to React predates this project but this was my first solo React project, built with the intention of being scalable and usable should BIC Auctions decide to host a standalone site. I used class and functional components and reusable components to maximize efficiency of components like modals. I also used React Browser Router to make the project a single-page application and used React Router Params to create dynamic pages.",

      "This app, which I will also convert into a React Redux website, serves to introduce me and my work to others in the dev community and potential clients. The React Native app is a smaller app meant to showcase my ability beyond websites and the website will likely include a few more pages and features. I wrote the content, set the base for branding, and worked with a designer to develop a personal logo.",
